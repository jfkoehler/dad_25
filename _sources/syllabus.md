**Course Description:**   This course aims to introduce students to the Python computing language. Students will write basic programs with Python, investigate the use of Python to perform data analysis (including machine learning and artificial intelligence), use Python to access and structure information from the web, and also use Python to build and deploy web based applications. The course will teach these skills through three projects 1\) Writing a Class to interact with csv files 2\) an exploratory data project and data visualization, and 3\) design and deployment of a personal web application with a predictive model. No prior experience with the Python computing language is required, however students are expected to own a laptop computer, or check one out from the University and bring it with them to every class. This course does not satisfy the second math requirement for the IS major but can count towards satisfying the IS elective requirement.

**Learning Outcomes**   
By the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand and use data types, variables, and collections in Python  
2. Understand and use conditionals and loops to solve problems in Python  
3. Use functions and classes to solve problems in Python  
4. Use pandas to interact with data in Python  
5. Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize data  
6. Use python to access data from API’s  
7. Use Flask to build basic web applications  
8. Use Flask to build interactive web applications  
9. Use CSS and Javascript to style Flask Applications  
10. Implement basic regression and classification models using scikitlearn  
11. Implement neural network models using pytorch  
12. Deploy machine learning models using Flask

**Community Agreements**

Community agreements are documents about classroom expectations for discussion and behavior that are created collaboratively between students and instructors. The agreement helps to build a foundation for an inclusive learning environment through the process of co-creation and transparency about expectations and boundaries. Following best practice, will build a community agreement early in the semester and revisit it as needed.

*Academic Integrity*   
Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university. 

Students are responsible for understanding the University’s policy on academic honesty and integrity and must make use of proper citations of sources for writing papers, creating, presenting, and performing their work, taking examinations, and doing research. It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others. Visit the [TNS University Policies A-Z webpage](http://www.newschool.edu/policies/) for the full text of the policy.  

For resources regarding what plagiarism is and how to avoid it visit the [TNS Learning Center website](http://www.newschool.edu/university-learning-center/student-resources/%20)

Student Code of Conduct: [https://www.newschool.edu/student-conduct/](https://www.newschool.edu/student-conduct/)

**Course Policies** 

You are expected to have a computer that you can install programs on and bring with you to class.  If you work on a windows computer, you are responsible for installing a terminal application on your computer that understands UNIX – likely [git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download). Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Responsibility   
Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late papers, failure to complete the readings assigned for class discussion, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions and presentations will jeopardize your successful completion of this course. 

Participation   
Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time. 

Canvas  
Use of Canvas may be an important resource for this class. Students should check it for announcements before coming to class each week. 

Delays   
In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class. If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival. In the event that I will miss class entirely, a sign will be posted at the classroom indicating your assignment for the next class meeting.

**Lang College Policies:** 

**Attendance**

At Lang College, students maximize their learning with peers and faculty when all members of the class are present and engaged in the regular collective work of the course. Attendance and participation lay the foundation for thriving in the classroom, whether in seminar, lecture, lab, studio, or practice-based classes. 

Though there can be many justifiable reasons for absence from class, multiple absences impact the learning environment for all students and warrant some grade reduction in an environment where learning is both individual and collective. 

Absences will be counted from the first day a student is enrolled in the class. Thus, after three (3) absences in a class that meets twice per week, the instructor will initiate a discussion between the student, the instructor, and Student Success Advisor (SSA) to devise a plan for attending class and meeting expectations for the remainder of the semester. This discussion can take place in person, via Zoom, or via email correspondence. For classes that meet once per week, this discussion will take place after two (2) absences.

For classes meeting twice per week, more than four (4) absences normally mandate withdrawal or a failing grade for the course. For classes meeting once per week, more than three (3) absences normally mandate withdrawal or a failing grade for the course. Any exception to this threshold is dependent upon the above mentioned plan of attendance with the instructor and SSA. 

**Resources**   
The university provides many resources to help students achieve academic and artistic excellence. These resources include:

* [**University Libraries**](https://library.newschool.edu/)**:**   
  The New School Libraries provide access to a vast array of print and electronic resources as well as personal research consultations, classroom instruction, and spaces for study and collaboration.

* [**University Learning Center**](https://www.newschool.edu/learning-center/)**:** For assistance with coursework during the semester, I encourage you to schedule free tutoring sessions at the University Learning Center (ULC). Individual appointments in Writing, Software, Computer Programming, Oral Presentations, Math, Time Management and ADHD Coaching are available from 7am-midnight Monday-Friday and 12-5pm on Saturdays. Online appointments are scheduled via [WCONLINE](https://newschool.mywconline.com/schedule.php) and in-person sessions or last minute virtual walk-ins can be requested by emailing [learningcenter@newschool.edu](mailto:learningcenter@newschool.edu). In-person sessions are held at 66 W. 12th St. on the 6th floor. The ULC also offers weekly and biweekly sessions.

* [**Title IX**](https://www.newschool.edu/title-ix/)

**Student Course Ratings**  
During the last two weeks of the semester, students are asked to provide feedback for each of their courses through an online survey. They cannot view grades until providing feedback or officially declining to do so. Course evaluations are a vital space where students can speak about the learning experience. It is an important process which provides valuable data about the successful delivery and support of a course or topic to both the faculty and administrators. Instructors rely on course rating surveys for feedback on the course and teaching methods, so they can understand what aspects of the class are most successful in teaching students, and what aspects might be improved or changed in future. Without this information, it can be difficult for an instructor to reflect upon and improve teaching methods and course design. In addition, program/department chairs and other administrators review course surveys. See these [instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UyzfjvYzOkN3iF5kDbk75Ii8piEKqKLc/view) for completing your course evaluations online.
